# Synergy Grade Getter
## A sophisticated and intuitive way of detecting grade changes. 
### As a stressed high school student, I found myself constantly checking my gradebook every twenty minutes or so. It was distracting and my grades were always in the back of my mind. To fix this, I created an automated way to detect grade changes and send me an SMS text whenever something changes.



## Libraries
1. [Selenium Webdriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-webdriver)
2. [Request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request)
  - Note: Request is deprecated. I will be updating to node-fetch, an up to date http client, as soon as I have time.
 
## Text Belt
In order to provide fast, secure, and clean text messages, I utilized a paid (but cheap) SMS service: [Text Belt](https://textbelt.com/). 
If you prefer not to pay, you can easily create a work-around by utilizing your own mail server and mapping to your carrier's SMS address. More explanation can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/textbelt/v/0.0.2). I also plan to implement this at some point.
